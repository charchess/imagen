## 1. Aesthetic Pillars
This guide establishes the visual standard for all hAIrem agents, drawing inspiration from high-fidelity digital illustrators (Miles-DF, Woflynail, F-R95, Fluff-Kevlar). The goal is "Tactile Presence"—agents should feel like they have physical weight, soft textures, and internal light.

### Key Influences
- **Expressive Anatomy (Woflynail/F-R95):** Focus on large, "liquid" eyes with complex reflections and expressive ear/tail positioning.
- **Material Fidelity (Fluff-Kevlar/Personnlami):** Mastery of textures—soft fur, smooth synthetic skin, and subsurface scattering (light passing through ears/skin).
- **Cinematic Lighting (Miles-DF):** Heavy use of rim lighting, volumetric glows, and dramatic color contrasts to define form.

## 2. Core Design Principles

### A. Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Primary:** Warm volumetric lighting to support the "Cozy" atmosphere.
- **Rim Lighting:** A strong "edge" light (often in the agent's theme color) must separate the agent from the background.
- **Subsurface Scattering:** Soft glow through thin parts (ears, wings, fins) to add realism and "life."

### B. Texture & Surface
- **Tactile Quality:** Materials should look touchable. Use high-frequency details for fur or fabric.
- **Digital Accents:** Subtle "Cyber" elements (glowing patterns, digital irises) integrated organically into the organic form.

### C. Anatomy of Expression
- **The Soul is in the Eyes:** High-detail pupils, multiple catchlights, and dynamic eyelid compression (based on FACS Action Units).
- **Secondary Cues:** Ears and tail (if applicable) must move in sync with facial expressions (e.g., flattened ears for `angry`, perked for `alert`).

## 3. Prompting Standards (for `nanobanana`)
When generating assets, use these mandatory keywords to maintain consistency:

**Style Block:**
> "Masterpiece, high-fidelity digital painting, cinematic lighting, volumetric atmosphere, rim lighting, soft fur texture, expressive eyes, subsurface scattering, detailed background, 8k resolution, professional illustration style, vibrant colors, sharp focus."

**Technical Requirement (Post-Processing Ready):**
For characters intended for UI integration, append:
> "Isolated on a solid flat white background, no shadows on the ground, high contrast between character and background, centered composition."

## 4. Integration & Post-Processing
To ensure seamless integration into the "Cyber-Cozy" environments:
- **Alpha Transparency:** Assets must be processed through the `rembg` pipeline (see Story 11.3) to remove the solid background.
- **Feathering:** A slight 1-2px edge blur (feathering) is recommended during integration to blend the "High-Fi" fur with the background.
- **Drop Shadows:** Shadows should be generated by the UI (CSS/VFX) rather than baked into the image asset.

## 4. Color Palette
- **Diva:** Deep purples / Neon highlights (The Performer).
- **Daphne:** Soft greens / Earthy tones (The Gardener).
- **Dulce:** Warm ambers / Honey glows (The Caretaker).
- **Test Model:** Neutral grays / Cyan accents (The Blueprint).

## 5. Integration with Expression Mapping
Every generated expression in `docs/scientific-expressions-inventory.md` must be filtered through this style. 
- *Example:* A `sad` expression isn't just a frown; it's a change to "cool, dim lighting" and "drooping ear silhouettes."
